# Password Generator

## Description 

My motivation for this project was to finish the code full and complete before the dealine which was difficult because I did not start physically coding until the day before the assignment deadline. This wasn't because I was lazy but because I was trying to really break down the thought process of psuedo coding. The reason I built this project or improved it was to make sure the functionality of the website can create the password with five inputs (length of password "8 to 128", upper case letters, lower case letter, numbers, and special characters.) the user selects. The problem that occurred with the code that I was given had no prompt giving the user a choice to select the password length , then a confirm prompt choice to select characters(upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters) they'd like it with in their password. After those promtpts there was a password that need to be generated with those inputs. I learned a lot about how to psuedo code with this project and also that in order to cut time at problem solving you have to be psuedocode and the deeper you go with it the less time you spend throwing unusable ideas out there. Reasons I see that my project stands out is that I was able to use Array.from to cut down the time that I was lacking  for not listing out the arrays in a certain way, also that I condensed my code using certain techniques I picked up during tutoring sessions.


## Installation


Steps for Installing:
1) Click my deplyed link to the web site

2) Click my GitHub repository link 
    a) Open the files for index.html, style.css, and script.js to copy or download files

3) View these repository files in your code application and view the steps I took. 


## Usage 

Steps for Usage:
1) First you click the "Generate Password" (big red button)

2) You are left with a prompt asking to to select the length you want you password to be which is anywhere between 8 to 128 nothing less and nothing more

3) Press "ok" if you you want a Uppercase letter for a character in your password, if not press "cancel"

4) Press "ok" if you you want a Lowercase letter for a character in your password, if not press "cancel"

5) Press "ok" if you you want a Number for a character in your password, if not press "cancel"

6) Press "ok" if you you want a Special Character for a character in your password, if not press "cancel"

7) After you do steps 2 through 6 you should recieve a generated password on the text box above the Big Red Button and you can go ahead and copy that password if you like it

8) If you don't like your password that is generated go ahead and repeat steps 1 through 6 until you see a password that you like
